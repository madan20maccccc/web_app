### 3. Language and Technical Stack

Our **OPD Prescription App** enables doctors to generate accurate, bilingual, and AI-assisted prescriptions from live voice conversations with patients. The solution integrates **BHASHINI APIs** for multilingual speech processing and **OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT API** for intelligent summarization and entity extraction. The final output is a structured prescription draft, with support for **SNOMED-CT** and **FHIR** currently under active development.

#### üîÅ End-to-End Workflow: From Voice to Drafted Prescription

Our real-time pipeline converts speech into structured clinical output as follows:

1. **üéôÔ∏è Voice Input Capture**  
   - Doctors initiate recording using a tap-to-record mic button.
   - Audio is captured using Flutter plugins with voice activity monitoring and permission handling.

2. **üåê Language Detection**  
   - BHASHINI‚Äôs **ALD API** detects the spoken Indian language automatically.

3. **üó£Ô∏è Speech-to-Text (ASR)**  
   - The voice is transcribed using **BHASHINI ASR API**, producing regional-language text.

4. **üìù Punctuation and Normalization**  
   - Text is cleaned using BHASHINI‚Äôs TN-ITN and punctuation services for grammar and number handling.

5. **üåç Translation (if needed)**  
   - If the language is not English, BHASHINI‚Äôs **Translation API** converts it to English.

6. **ü§ñ Entity Extraction & Summarization**  
   - The final English transcript is sent to **OpenAI ChatGPT API** (gpt-4 or gpt-3.5-turbo) to extract:
     - Patient complaints
     - Diagnosis (if mentioned)
     - Prescribed medicines (name, strength, dosage, duration)
     - Lifestyle or follow-up advice

7. **üìå SNOMED-CT Integration** *(In Progress)*  
   - A local JSON-based lookup for SNOMED-CT codes is being developed to standardize extracted medical entities.

8. **üì¶ FHIR Output Generation** *(In Progress)*  
   - A custom script is under development to convert structured prescription data into **FHIR-compliant JSON** for integration with **eHospital** and **ABDM**.

9. **üìÑ Prescription Draft Generation**  
   - A formatted and shareable PDF is generated showing:
     - Doctor details
     - Patient details
     - Structured prescription
     - Timestamp and QR (optional)

10. **‚òÅÔ∏è Data Storage**  
   - Audio, transcripts, and prescription PDFs are stored securely in **Firebase Storage**.
   - Associated metadata is saved in **Firestore** for future reference or sharing.
